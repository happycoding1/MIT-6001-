"""

In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

"""


low = 0
mid = 50
high = 100
secretnum = "Is your secret number: "
print ("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
print secretnum + str(mid) + "?"
guess = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. ")
while (guess != 'c'):
    if (guess == 'h'):
        high = mid
        mid = int((mid + low)/2)
    elif (guess == 'l'):
        low = mid
        mid = int((mid + high)/2)
    else:
        print (Sorry, I did not understand your input.)
    print (secretnum + str(mid) + "?")
    guess = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. ")
if (guess == 'c'):
    print ("Game over. Your secret number was:", mid)
