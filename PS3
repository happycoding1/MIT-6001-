    Please read the Hangman Introduction before starting this problem. The helper
    functions you will be creating in the next three exercises are simply
    suggestions, but you DO have to implement them if you want to get points for
    this Hangman Problem Set. If you'd prefer to structure your Hangman program in
    a different way, feel free to redo this Problem Set in a different way.
    However, if you're new to programming, or at a loss of how to construct this
    program, we strongly suggest that you implement the next three helper functions
    before continuing on to Hangman Part 2.
    We'll start by writing 3 simple functions that will help us easily code the
    Hangman problem. First, implement the function isWordGuessed that takes in two
    parameters - a string, secretWord, and a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This
    function returns a boolean - True if secretWord has been guessed (ie, all the
    letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed) and False otherwise.
    """

def isWordGuessed(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    '''
        secretWord: string, the word the user is guessing
        lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
        returns: boolean, True if all the letters of secretWord are in lettersGuessed;
        False otherwise
        '''
    
    for x in secretWord:
        if x not in lettersGuessed:
            return False
    return True

"""
    Next, implement the function getGuessedWord that takes in two parameters - a
    string, secretWord, and a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This function
    returns a string that is comprised of letters and underscores, based on what
    letters in lettersGuessed are in secretWord. This shouldn't be too different
    from isWordGuessed!
    """

def getGuessedWord(secretWord, lettersGuessed):
    '''
        secretWord: string, the word the user is guessing
        lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
        returns: string, comprised of letters and underscores that represents
        what letters in secretWord have been guessed so far.
        '''
    
    my_String = ''
    for x in secretWord:
        if x in lettersGuessed:
            my_String += x
        else:
            my_String += '_'
    return my_String

"""
    Next, implement the function getAvailableLetters that takes in one parameter -
    a list of letters, lettersGuessed. This function returns a string that is
    comprised of lowercase English letters - all lowercase English letters that
    are not in lettersGuessed.
    """

def getAvailableLetters(lettersGuessed):
    '''
        lettersGuessed: list, what letters have been guessed so far
        returns: string, comprised of letters that represents what letters have not
        yet been guessed.
        '''
    
    notGuessed = ''
    for x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        if x not in lettersGuessed:
            notGuessed += x
    return notGuessed

def hangman(secretWord):
    '''
        secretWord: string, the secret word to guess.
        
        Starts up an interactive game of Hangman.
        
        * At the start of the game, let the user know how many
        letters the secretWord contains.
        
        * Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.
        
        * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
        about whether their guess appears in the computers word.
        
        * After each round, you should also display to the user the
        partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the
        user has not yet guessed.
        
        Follows the other limitations detailed in the problem write-up.
